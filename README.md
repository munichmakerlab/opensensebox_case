# OpenSenseBox Case Mounting hardware

Just two designs to mount the OpenSenseBox units inside the FIBOX Piccolo PC D 85 T case, instead o hotglueing everything together. Needs a few M3 screws, and some random bigger ones to screw it into the existing mounting holes in the case (we just chose a few from our box of random screws).

Files were cut on a CO2 Laser Cutter in 3mm clear acrylic.
